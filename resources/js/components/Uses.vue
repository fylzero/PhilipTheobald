        <h2>Office</h2>
        <p>Here's a couple (older, I will take new ones soon) photos of my home office.  I live in a one bedroom brick and timber loft with my girlfriend Karina, 3 guinea pigs (Spaghetti, Fettuccine and Lasagna) and a betta fish named Cheeto. Located between Little Village and Pilsen in Chicago, Illinois.</p>

        <h2>Desk</h2>
        <p><a href="https://www.autonomous.ai/standing-desks/smartdesk-2-business?option1=1&option2=6&option16=36&option17=41" target="blank">SmartDesk 2 Business Edition with a white frame and bamboo top</a> from Autonomous.  Extremely sturdy.  I love that this desk sits at the exact heights I prefer for sitting and standing and it looks beautiful.</p>

        <h2>Chair</h2>
        <p>I use an <a href="https://www.autonomous.ai/office-chairs/ergonomic-chair?option20=50" target="blank">Ergo Chair 2 in Evergreen</a>, also from Autonomous.  Sturdy, comfy, ergonomic, doesn't squeak.  I actually sold my Herman Miller Embody chair for this and I have zero regrets.</p>

        <h2>Monitor</h2>
        <p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07GWDGVGT/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o06_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1" target="blank">Asus VA325H 31.5-Inch LED Monitor</a> which I bought refurbished on Amazon for under $200.  High resolution, not the best color reproduction but good for coding and watching videos.  The monitor stand I use is from Autonomous as well.</p>

        <h2>Audio</h2>
        <p>I have a pair of <a href="https://www.zzounds.com/item--MACMR824" target="blank">Mackie MR824 Studio Monitors</a>, a <a href="https://www.zzounds.com/item--MACMRS10" target="blank">Mackie MRS10 Powered Studio Subwoofer</a> and a pair of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Klipsch-ProMedia-Certified-Computer-Speaker/dp/B000062VUO" target="blank">Klipsch Promedia 2.1 Desktop Speakers</a> hooked up with my <a href="https://www.zzounds.com/item--FOCSCAR2I4V2" target="blank">Scarlett Focusrite 2i4 Audio Interface</a>.  I tested tons of studio montor speakers at Guitar Center and landed on these because the low mid and treb frequencies really stood out on the Mackie's to me.  They have a bit of color to the sound but they are very clear and punchy. I use the Klipsch 2.1 speaker set along side the Mackie's to fill out the higher mid range sound for now.  I have the subwwoofer on the Klipsch very low for a bit of top-end lower punch but the Mackie sub is handling all the low end rumble.  Eventually I want to swap out the Klipsch set for some white-face Yamaha monitors.  Likely will do a 6 inch set to drive vocals more.</p>

        <h2>Hub</h2>
        <p>Everything is hooked up to my Macbook Pro using a small simple <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B071G83L1J/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o04_s01?ie=UTF8&psc=1" target="blank">Anker USB C Hub</a>.</p>

        <h2>Computer</h2>
        <p>I am rocking a nicely spec'd out <a href="https://www.bhphotovideo.com/bnh/controller/home?O=email&A=details&Q=&sku=1423791&is=REG" target="blank">Macbook Pro with Retina Display and Touchbar</a> that I got from B&H Photo with a $700 discount.  Woot!  2.9GHz 6‑core 8th‑generation Intel Core i9 processor (Turbo Boost up to 4.8GHz).  32GB 2400MHz DDR4 memory.  Radeon Pro 560X with 4GB of GDDR5 memory.  2TB SSD storage.</p>

        <h2>Keyboard &amp; Mouse</h2>
        <p>Sigh...   yes...  I spent a boatload of money on the space grey Apple Magic Keyboard and Magic Mouse 2.  I actually really like the mac keyboard and have gotten very used to it.  I've always been a fan of the magic mouse, especially for multiscreen switching.</p>

        <h2>Phone</h2>
        <p>I have the Samsung Galaxy S10+ in Ceramic Black with 512GB internal memory.</p>

        <h2>Code Editor</h2>
        <p>I was a big Sublime Text user for a few years, wound up switching to Atom for a bit...  these days I am rocking <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/" target="blank">Visual Studio Code</a>.  Everyone else switched to it, so I hopped on the bandwagon.  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯</p>

        <h2>Headphones</h2>
        <p>I bought a set of <a href="https://www.nuraphone.com/" target="blank">Nuraphones</a> and OMG!  These things are RIDICULOUSLY AMAZING!  The bass isn't even deep, it is PROFOUND AF!  They're so clear.  It's like sitting the perfect distance from blasted studio monitors at a professional studio everytime I put them on.</p>

        <h2>Other Apps I Use</h2>
        <p>Gmail - I manage multiple accounts from a single inbox and it's great.</p>
        <p>Spotify - For music.</p>
        <p>Evernote - For taking notes.</p>
        <p>Todoist - My preferred todo list app.</p>
        <p>Remembear - Password Manager.</p>
        <p>Slack - What did we do before this existed, honestly?</p>
        <p>iTerm2 - Terminal of choice.  I use the Agnoster config found <a href="https://medium.com/swlh/power-up-your-terminal-using-oh-my-zsh-iterm2-c5a03f73a9fb" target="blank">here</a>.</p>
