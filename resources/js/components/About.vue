        <p>I am a full-stack (albeit front-end leaning) web developer.</p>
        <p>I loved science as a kid.  I wrote my first HTML page in 1996.</p>
        <p>As a teenager, I enjoyed learning about and building computers.  I watched the movie Hackers more times than I care to admit.  I dropped out of high school.  Got my GED.  I was offered a full scholarship to college.  Dropped out of college.  I became A+ certified and worked in computer hardware and networking jobs for the better part of my 20s.</p>
        <p>In 2009 I found myself working for a grocery-store-focused point-of-sale company as a support technician.  Everyone at the company was answering support calls and logging everything by physical pen and paper.  With calls coming in from clients almost non-stop, suffice it to say, it left much to be desired.</p>
        <p>At that time, I knew just enough PHP to be dangerous.  So, I began to build a basic system using PHP and MySQL to log support issues for our clients and for my own sanity.  I would do my customer support job during the day, head back to my apartment in the evening and build out more features to this ticket system software that I wrote every single day.  Eventually other colleagues in my office asked to have access to it...  After a while, my entire office was using it.  At some point one of the managers from the Florida branch office had come up to Chicago and noticed the system we were all using.  He thought it looked great and asked what it would take for them to get on the system as well.</p>
        <p>After some conversations with management about deployment and structuring, my software wound up in half of our offices across the country, including our company headquarters in Nebraska.  Once that happened, working on and supporting the system became half my job and I still am licensing and supporting it to this day.  I eventually branded the company DeskNinja and have been working on a commercial release for the last year or so.  This all became the catalyst for teaching myself how to code HTML, CSS, PHP, SQL, etc. over the years.</p>
        <p>Instead of binging Netflix, I was addicted to Lynda.com, PluralSight, Udemy, YouTube, StackOverflow, etc. to learn as much as I could.</p>
        <p>By 2013, my confidence in my coding skills had grown enough to switch career paths.  Which is exactly what I did.</p>
        <p>I've spent the last decade learning more and more everyday and working in an industry that I absolutely love.</p>
